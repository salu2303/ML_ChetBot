which are then removed in your urine.', 'Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes to build up in your body.', 'In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you might have few signs or symptoms.', 'You might not realize that you have kidney disease until the condition is advanced.', 'Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of kidney damage, usually by controlling the cause.', 'But, even controlling the cause might not keep kidney damage from progressing.', 'Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.', 'How kidneys work\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nSigns and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly.', 'Loss of kidney function can cause a buildup of fluid or body waste or electrolyte problems.', \"Depending on how severe it is, loss of kidney function can cause:\\n\\nNausea\\n\\nVomiting\\n\\nLoss of appetite\\n\\nFatigue and weakness\\n\\nSleep problems\\n\\nUrinating more or less\\n\\nDecreased mental sharpness\\n\\nMuscle cramps\\n\\nSwelling of feet and ankles\\n\\nDry, itchy skin\\n\\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control\\n\\nShortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs\\n\\nChest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart\\n\\nSigns and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific.\", 'This means they can also be caused by other illnesses.', 'Because your kidneys are able to make up for lost function, you might not develop signs and symptoms until irreversible damage has occurred.', 'When to see a doctor\\n\\nMake an appointment with your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of kidney disease.', 'Early detection might help prevent kidney disease from progressing to kidney failure.', 'If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor may monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during office visits.', 'Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you.', 'Causes\\n\\nNormal kidney vs. diseased kidney Open pop-up dialog box Close Normal kidney vs. diseased kidney Normal kidney vs. diseased kidney A normal kidney has about 1 million filtering units.', 'Each unit, called a glomerulus, connects to a tubule, which collects urine.', 'Conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes take a toll on kidney function by damaging these filtering units and collecting tubules and causing scarring.', \"Polycystic kidney Open pop-up dialog box Close Polycystic kidney Polycystic kidney A healthy kidney (left) eliminates waste from the blood and maintains the body's balance.\", 'With polycystic kidney disease (right), fluid-filled sacs called cysts develop in the kidneys, causing them to grow larger and gradually lose their ability to function normally.', 'Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years.', \"Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease
